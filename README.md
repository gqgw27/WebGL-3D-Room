# WebGL Assignment - gqgw27


## Installation
A web server is required in order to run and load the textures properly. To install a simple web server, use the node package manager ([npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)) and install **http-server**.
```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

## Usage
Ensuring the command window is opened in the main directory, run :
```bash
http-server
```
The web server will be running at http://localhost:8080/

In the browser go to http://localhost:8080/. 

**While google chrome is capable to run the content, _Microsoft edge_ or _Mozilla Firefox_ will run the content much smoother and should be used where possible.**
